Use Counterpoint to easily cycle between file counterparts (.h, .cpp, .osx.mm, win.cpp, and so on) via the :CounterpointNext and :CounterpointPrevious commands.

Counterpoint works by taking the current file, determining the root file name, and switching between files with the same root but different extensions. This allows Counterpoint to operate on multi-level file extensions instead of just the traditional .h and .cpp pairs, and allows it to cycle in a natural way without any configuration beyond mapping at least one of the command commands in your .vimrc, perhaps like so:

nnoremap <leader>a :CounterpointNext
